    <p class="lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</P> 
    <p class="copy"> At first you might think that Professor Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic
        mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing there. Upon reflection, however, it would become
        clear that the mentions belied a deep set obsession with the odiforous bulb. Making many
        question whether there was vampire trauma in his past.</P>
    <p class="note">It was an obsession that would eventually lead to his demise</P>
